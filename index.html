            <h2>What Are Blockchain & IOT</h2>
            <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> ~ Written by TYMO, May 27, 2021.</h5>
            <h5><span class="label label-danger">Intro</span> </h5>

            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) can be considered as an interconnected system based on
                approved protocols which exchange information. With the popularity of IoT technology, the security of the IoT network has become an important issue. Blockchains purpose is to give this problem its solution- it enables two entities who don’t trust each other (but want to) to communicate. At its core, a blockchain system consists of a distributed digital ledger, shared between participants in the system, that resides on the Internet. Transactions or events are validated and recorded in the ledger and cannot subsequently be amended or removed. It provides a way for information to be recorded and shared by a community of users.
                In short, the Blockchain allows both logging and transparency of any data for the company while ensuring the data is not forged. Blockchain can be used as an intrusion detection system (IDS) to guarantee the safety of that data.

                The Internet of Things (IoT) is establishing itself as part of the future Internet. One of the technical challenges of having billions of devices deployed worldwide is the ability to manage them. Although access management technologies exist in IoT, they have a variety of technical limitations to manage them globally. Blockchain technology could be used as access management technology in specific scalable IoT scenarios.

                In relation to cyber security, Blockchain can be used to secure overall systems or devices by decentralising their administration. This approach allows the device to make security decisions on their own. Not depending on the central admin or authority, makes the edge devices more secure by detecting and acting on suspicious commands from unknown networks. Normally, hackers penetrate the central administration of a device and automatically gain full control of the devices and systems. By decentralising such device authority systems, blockchain ensures such attacks are harder to execute (if even possible).

                <b><u>Internet of Things: Security & Privacy challenges</u></b><br>
                The IoT is a comprehensive term referring to ongoing efforts to connect a wide variety of physical things to communication networks. Currently, the Internet has not only conventional computers connected but also a significant heterogeneity of equipment such as TVs, laptops, fridges, stoves, electrical appliances, cars, and smartphones.
                The devices in the IoT collect, generate, and process data and send this information via the Internet, producing a considerable mass of information to be used by various services. Despite the benefits, critical issues related to privacy may emerge.
                There is a demand for security solutions that are capable of providing equivalent levels of security for various types of devices and demands mechanisms capable of audit and access control in these environments.
                In this context, that Blockchain also falls, because this technology can be used to authenticate, authorize, and audit data generated by devices. Also, because of its decentralized nature, it eliminates the need to trust in the third party and does not have a single point of failure.

               <p>Blockchain can enable parties with no particular trust in each other to exchange digital data on a peer-to-peer basis with fewer or no third parties or intermediaries. At its core blockchain in the IoT devices was intended to work on bitcoins (meaning in the economy field), but the potential of Blockchain in IoT devices can be seen in many other fields. Data could correspond, for instance, to money, insurance policies, contracts, land titles, medical and educational records, birth and marriage certificates, buying and selling goods and services, or any transaction or asset that can be translated into a digital form. The potential of blockchain to engender wide-ranging changes in the economy, industry and society – both now and tomorrow – is tremendous. Here are some examples for fields blockchain in IoT devices can transform.

                <b>Cellular companies:</b> Several companies are experimenting with the integration of blockchain technology in mobile phones, smart tags and other IoT devices to scan QR codes in their products’ labels and access information in a blockchain about their
                origin, production process, quality, expiry dates, lot numbers, and so on.

               <br> <b>Shipping companies:</b> IoT devices are attached to shipping containers to keep track of actual movements and added to a blockchain system, in this case based on Hyperledger. This secure and unique record is shared between all participating companies along the supply chain, with the goal of improving operational flows, resource management and route-optimisation planning. In the future, data could flow seamlessly between the companies’ operational information management systems using blockchain systems, within a transparent and encrypted multi-party.

               <br> <b>Food supply industry:</b> blockchain-based systems could provide an accurate and updated record of products along their production, shipment and sale. For example, in the case of outbreaks we can use the IoT devices attached to all outbound products to determine more quickly and precisely the points of contamination transaction ecosystem.

                <br><b>Manufacturers and Factories:</b> As a tamper resistant digital record, a blockchain that is related to IoT-monitored devices could register information on location, availability or status alongside any data such as physical qualities, design specifications, materials used, ownership, place of manufacture, maintenance history, certifications or warranties.

                <br><b>The Medical industry: </b>Data confidentiality, authentication and security are major concerns in the medical field. Blockchain could provide permanent records to be verified and accessed much quicker.  Drugs and other products could be tagged with IoT devices, authenticated and recorded in a blockchain. This could prevent and/or enable quicker detection of counterfeits, theft or misplacements along a complex multi-party network of producers, manufacturers, regulatory agencies, suppliers, distributors and others. It could help to keep track of the environmental conditions required for the transport of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as temperature and time.

            <h2>Current Problems With Implementing Blockchain In IOT And It's future
            </h2>
            <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post BY TYMO, Cybint Bootcampers , May 27, 2021.</h5>
            <h5><span class="label label-warning">Problems and future</span></h5>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The trade-off between power consumption, performance, and security:</b><br>The high computational power required to run Blockchain algorithms has slowed down the advancement of these technology-based applications on resource constrained devices. In order to deal with that problem, researchers suggested optimizing Block chain’s central algorithms to increase the number of confirmed blocks per second. For instance, elimination of the BC Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism can reduce power consumption and improve performance. On the contrary, PoW prevents malicious Sybil attacks and makes the Blocks tamper-proof. Consequently, the goal is to refine BC processes to appropriately align security and efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#problems">Read more..</button>
            <div id="problems" class="collapse">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Data concurrency and throughput issue :</b><br> In IoT systems, the devices share their data continuously which result with high concurrency. The BC throughput is limited because of it’s special cryptographic, security protocol and consensus mechanism.
                    The challenge is to boost BC’s throughout to meet the need of high frequent transactions in IoT systems.
                </li>
                <li><b>Connectivity challenges of IoT :</b><br> IoT devices need to be connected to a high computing storage and networking resources so they would be able to share their data continuously with potential stakeholders. IoT has limited capabilities to connect the devices with BC technology to create business opportunities in order to implement new applications and services in various domains.</li>
                <li><b>Handling Big data on the Blockchain:</b><br> In the Blockchain network, every participant maintains a local copy of the complete distributed ledger. Upon the confirmation of a new Block, the Block is broadcast throughout the entire peer-to-peer network, and every node appends the confirmed Block to their local ledger. While this decentralised storage structure improves efficiency, solves the bottleneck problem and removes the need for third-party trust, the management of IoT data on the Blockchain puts a burden on participants’ storage space.

                </li>
                <li><b>Challenges in maintaining both transparency and privacy:</b><br> Blockchain can guarantee transparency of transactions, which is essential in some applications like finance. However, user’s confidentiality may be adversely affected when storing and accessing IoT data from certain IoT systems. To maintain a balanced degree of transparency and privacy, the development of cost-effective access control for IoT using Blockchain is necessary.
                </li>
                <li><b>Regulating challenges of BC in IoT:</b><br> While several BC technological features including decentralization, immutability, anonymity, and automation are promising security solutions for diverse IoT applications, these features combined pose various new regulatory challenges. The immutability feature implies that data is permanently published in DTL (Dynamic Transport Protocol) on the peer-to-peer network and cannot be deleted or modified. In addition, due to the absence of governance, records cannot be filtered for maintaining privacy before publishing them on the BC.Actions resulting from executing code such as smart contracts on a DTL can breach law. Due to the anonymity of the DTL, it is not so straightforward to distinguish the parties carrying out transactions for illegal services. Current IoT laws and regulations are becoming outdated especially with the advent of new disruptive technology such as Blockchain and need to be revised to undertake the DTL.

                </li>
            </ul><br>
                <p><b><u>It’s a Matter of Time</u></b><br><br>

                    According to a study of Cisco and BCG there is a great potential combining the two technologies. The advantage is clear, data will become not only digitized but also less costly and more accessible. IoT needs blockchain so that more enterprises can get more access to this data in truly real time. In the short run, the combination of blockchain and IoT will mainly focus on driving efficiencies inside companies and further automation of the paper trails needed to satisfy risk and regulatory requirements.
                    Over the longer term, as both technologies mature, companies will use blockchain with IoT to develop and scale new revenue streams. Dynamics will shift as new business models materialize.
